This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started.

Follow instructions in Developer Guide for setting up the local development environment.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Errors

- Can't log out? If you get an error preventing you from logging out:
  please modify the /components/Navbar.jsx file per comments
  at the top of the file.

## Dreamhost-mtl folder

- This contains a folder and an HTM file to be uploaded to the HTML hosting service, Dreamhost (as opposed to Vercel for JS). The HTM file has been converted to HTM from an Excel file due to partner concerns, which explains the evident errors. The file still works. We will continue to work with the partner on a better solution when they have more time to provide necessary materials.
